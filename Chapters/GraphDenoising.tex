\chapter{Graph Denoising}




\section{Graph Foundations}
A graph is defined as  $G = \langle V,E \rangle$, where $V$ is a set of 
vertices (or nodes) and $E$ is a set of edges (or links). 
Edges are defined as a set of tuples $(i, j)$, where $i$ and $j$ determine the 
index of the vertices in the graph.

Edges can be either \textit{directed} or \textit{undirected} and that has to do with the position of the 
nodes in the edge. In a directed graph, a edge points explicitly from
one node to another, which means that edge $(i, j) \neq (j, i)$. 
In undirected graphs the ordering does not matter and  $(i, j) = (j, i)$.

Moreover, edges can have weights, which is a method to define importance to the neighbours of a node.
If edges are dealing with weights, we are talking from a \textit{weighted} graph.
The \textit{neighbourhood} of a node $\mathcal{N(i)} = \forall x $ is defined as all the adjacent node 
of $i$, which means that there is an edge between the nodes. 

\paragraph{Adjacency matrix:}
To do calculations with graphs, it is common to translate graphs in a well suitable mathematically
form, which are matrices.
The adjacency matrix can be seen as a way of representing graphs as a matrix.
The (binary) adjacency matrix of graph $G$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eg:AdjacencyMatrix}
    A_{ij} =    
    \begin{cases}
        %1  & \text{if } \norm{\biggl y_i - y_j \biggr} < \tau\\
        1  & \text{if } (i, j) \in E \\
        0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The matrix $A$ has dimension $\mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ and the indices of the matrix correspond to the nodes of the graph.
If there is an edge between two nodes, the entry in the matrix will be set to $1$, otherwise to $0$.
This leads to an unweighted graph, as the weight of all edges will be $1$. 

When the graph is undirected, the resulting matrix will be symmetric and has a complete set of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors. The set of eigenvalues are also called \textit{spectrum} of the graph.

\paragraph{Degree matrix:}
The degree matrix of $G$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    D_{ij} =    
    \begin{cases}
        %1  & \text{if } \norm{\biggl y_i - y_j \biggr} < \tau\\
        deg(v_i)  & \text{if } i = j \\
        0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where $deg(v_i)$ is the degree of the node, formally the number of incoming edges of node $v_i$.

\paragraph{Graph Laplacian:}
The graph Laplacian is a matrix that represents the graph and can be used to find many important properties of the graph, 
which are not handled here but a good overview can be found by \cite{tutorialSpectralClustering, SpectralGraphTheory}. 
It is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    L = D - A
\end{equation}



\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
    Cryo-EM reconstruction needs to define algorithms, which works well in high noise regimes.
    During Master Thesis only on single-particle cryo-EM is considered, so speaking from cryo-EM 
    it refers to single-particle cryo-EM.
\end{tcolorbox}



\subsection{Graph Construction}
3) General framework for constructing a graph:
a) Each vertex is associated to some feature/signal/whatever $x\in \mathcal{X}$, for some space arbitrary space $\mathcal{X}$.
b) We construct the graph $G_0$ using: $d(x_i,x_j) < \tau$, $\tau$ is a threshold, or k-NN (defined it here in one line).
c) For simplification, and because it covers already most cases, we will work on $\mathcal{x}= R^M$
d) There are some applications, as we will see (or have seen if already introduced), where we have only access to a noisy version of the true signal:
 $y = x + \eta$, where $y,x \in R^N$, and eta i.i.d follow Gaussian $(0,sigma^2)$.
e) Then we defined the noisy graph G as in b)

\label{sec:graphConstruction}
When data is not available as a graph, it can be constructed from the data.
First of all, every element of the dataset can be seen as a node and only the decision of how edges will be constructed
is necessary. One popular approach is k-nearest neighbour (KNN) graph construction. The parameter $k$
defines how many edges every node will have at the end. The neighbourhood of node $i$ is defined
as $\mathcal{N}_i$ and consists of the nodes, with the $k$ smallest similarity measure.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eg:knn}
    A_{ij} =    
    \begin{cases}
        %1  & \text{if } \norm{\biggl y_i - y_j \biggr} < \tau\\
        1  & \text{if } j \in \mathcal{N}_i \\
        0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Instead of using a fixed parameter $k$ as in KNN approach, one could define a threshold $\pi$
and connection nodes if the similarity measure is smaller than $\pi$. This is another common way
to define graphs and results in a graph, where not all nodes have the same amount of edges.

\section{Graph Denoising}
\textbf{TODO: Not the name in literature}

Data acquired by real-world observations are often noisy, which can lead to poor 
performance on data analysis tasks. Graph constructed by noisy data is called
a noisy graph, as it includes the noise from observations.

Graph denoising is the task to reconstruct the original graph from a noisy one.


Denoising in general has often to do with averaging 
 and graphs are a well suited data structure for this task\cite{noneLocalMean}.

\paragraph{Noise:}
A noisy observation is defined as:
$y_n = y + \eta$, where $\eta$ is the observation noise (often assumed to be gaussian distributed)
and $y$ the noiseless observation.

\paragraph{Denoising:}
When we talk from denoising, we want to reconstruct the true observation 
from a given noisy observation. 
Reconstruction is done via averaging, that can be performed
locally, by the calculus of variations or in the frequency domain\cite{noneLocalMean}.

\paragraph{Noisy Graph:}
For every noisy graph, there exists an original graph $G = \langle V,E \rangle$.

The noisy graph can be defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        G_{noisy} &= \langle V,E_{noisy} \rangle,  \\ 
        \text{ with }  E_{noisy} &= E \setminus  E^{-} \cup  E^{+}, \\ 
         E^{-} & \subseteq E, \\
         E^{+} \cap E &= \emptyset
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The noisy graph consists of the same vertices as the original graph. From
the original graphs edges, some are removed (denoted by $E^{-}$) and some are added
(denoted by $E^{+}$).

The adjacency matrix of $G_{noisy}$ is denoted by $\bar{A}_{ij}$.
The task of graph denoising, can therefore be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{A} \xrightarrow[method]{Graph-denoising} \tilde{A} \approx A
\end{equation}

Where $\bar{A}$, $\tilde{A}$, $A$ denotes the adjacency matrix from noisy input graph, denoised
 graph and original graph respectively.

\subparagraph{Connection to link prediction}
Link prediction is a task in Graph Learning. 
The idea is to predict existence of a link (edge) between two nodes.
The task can be formulated as a missing value estimation task. A model $M_p$ is learned
from a given set of observed edges. The model finally maps links to probabilities
$M_p : E^{\prime} \rightarrow [0,1]$ where $E^{\prime}$ is the set of potential links.

We define $U$ as the set of all possible vertices of $G$, therefore $E \subseteq U$.
Obviously, graph denoising can be seen as a link prediction problem.

The difference is, that in link prediction a model from a set of observed links is learned
$E_{observed} \subseteq E$ and in graph denoising the model is learned from 
$E_{observed} \subseteq U$. 


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
    On could also say that link prediction problems are a subset of graph denoising problems.
\end{tcolorbox}



\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
    Finally, the goal of the master thesis is to produce methods to estimate 
    $G_0$ based on G. 
    (You can put it in a tcolorbox or something similar to show that this is the most important things to read here). 
    To do so, we will focus on a particular problem where this setting makes sense: cryo-EM. And to solve this problem, we will try to connect with recent machine learning techniques
    (if you follow the plan that proposed below)
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Graph Laplacian}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
    5) Graph Laplacian and machine learning: this is one on the main idea to explore in the thesis. 
Graph Laplacian is a powerful tool, but relies on the noisy adjacency matrix. 
Can we learn the adjacency matrix such that the output of the Graph Laplacian is what we expected (link with spectrum folded).

6) Mathematical analysis of the link between Graph neural network and Graph Laplacian, as in the paper "Simplifying graph convolutional networks". 
Another strong idea to explore.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Manifolds}
2.3: use mathematic definitions.
To avoid heavy definition that we won't need: 
Let $\mathcal{M} = \{ f(x), f is C^K, f: R^d \to R^N \}$. 
In this thesis, we will consider $C^k$ dfferentiable d-dimensional manifold defined by $\mathcal{M}$.

Embedding -> low dimensional embedding: mapping that goes from a high dimensional space to a low dimensional one. 
For instance, using the previous definition, an embedding on M is a function that maps $\mathcal{M} \to R^d$.


suggestion on Sections 2.3:
1) Definitions: manifold and then embedding, but special case (not general definition that is heavy and not needed).
2) 2 simple examples: circle (d=1, N=2) and one embedding, sphere (d=2,N=3) or more general d-dimensional sphere 
$S^d = {x \in R^{d+1}, \|x\|=1}$. 
3) link with signal processing (paragraph currently called "Manifold assumption")
