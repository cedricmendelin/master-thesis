Inverse problems refer to the process, which, from observed data, derive a model that produces
the data. They are widely used throughout different science directions, such as Machine Learning (ML),
signal processing, computer vision, natural language processing and many more.

In recent years, Graphs got a lot of attention in ML and are one of the most promising research areas.
Graphs are a well suited data structure, simple but with high expressiveness 
and, therefore, well suited in ML. Data can be in a graph structure already, like social networks, or
they can be constructed easily.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), where molecules are imaged in an electron microscope,
gained a lot of attention in recent years. 
Due to ground-breaking improvements regarding hardware and data processing, the field of research
has highly improved. In the year 2017, the pioneers in the field of cryo-EM even got the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry\footnote{https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2017/press-release/}
Today, using cryo-Em many molecular structures can be displayed with near-atomic resolution.

The following report resulted as the Master Thesis Preparation report. During the six weeks project, 
the aim was to familiarize with the research direction, build up the mathematically foundation needed 
for the Thesis itself and define the project content and an overall project plan.

\bigskip

The report is structured as the following:
In chapter~\ref{sec:foundation}, the overall foundation for the Master Thesis will be given, focusing 
on Graph Learning, Graph Denoising, some mathematically methods and definitions as well as
 a short introduction to cryo-EM.
Chapter~\ref{sec:preliminariesProblem} is dedicated to the problem setup and some preliminaries of the problem. 
Moreover, the base idea of the Master Thesis is defined.
Up to this point, the underlying problem has been defined and some related work can be given in chapter~\ref{sec:relatedWork}.
