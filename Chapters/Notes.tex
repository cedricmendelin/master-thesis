\section{Deep Learning on Graphs}

\subsection{Graph Convolutional Network}
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) \cite{GCN} can be used for many tasks in the field 
of Graph Learning, such as node classification or link prediction. 
Basically, with GCN, a new feature representation is iteratively learned for the node features.

The basic concept is as follows:
For a given graph $G = \langle V,E \rangle$, with node features $X^{N x D}$ and adjacency Matrix $A$
where $N$ denotes the number of nodes and $D$ the number of node input attributes.

A novel node representation $Z^{N x F}$ will be learned, where $F$ is the number of output features.

$Z$ will be learned within a neural network, and every layer can be written the following, non-linear function:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        H^{l + 1} = f ( H^l, A), \\
        \text{with } H^0 = X \text{ and } H^L = Z, \text{ where L is the number of layers }
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Every layer of the network, can be described

\section{Noise}
A noisy observation is defined as:
$y_n = y + \eta$

\subsection{Denoising}
When we talk from denoising, we want to reconstruct the true observation 
from a given noisy observation. This reconstruction is done via averaging, which can be performed
locally, by the calculus of variations or in the frequency domain.

\subsubsection{Non local means}
Non local means is a state-of-the-art image denoising method \cite{noneLocalMean}.
In the name of the method are two important concepts, namely the \textit{mean}
and \textit{non local}.

For a given noisy image $v$, the denoised image is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    NL[v](i) = \sum{w(i,j)v(j)}
\end{equation}

where $w(i,j)$ is the weight between pixel $i$ and $j$ and fulfils two conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0 \le w(i,j) \le 1$
    \item $\sum_j{w(i,j) = 1}$
\end{itemize}

Without going into detail, the weight can be seen as a similarity measure of the two pixels.
Moreover, are these similarities calculated over square neighbourhoods of the two pixels.
Similar pixel neighbourhoods have a large weight and different neighbourhoods have a small weight.

More general, the denoised image pixel $i$ is computed 
as an weighted average of all pixels in the image, therefore, in a non local way.

\section{Graph definition}
A graph is defined as  $G = \langle V,E \rangle$, where $V$ is a set of 
vertices (or nodes) and $E$ is a set of edges (or links). Edges are 
defined as a set of tuples $\langle i,j \rangle$, where $i$ and $j$ determine the 
index of the vertices in the graph.

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}

The adjacency Matrix of $G$ is then defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    A_{ij} =    
    \begin{cases}
        %1  & \text{if } \norm{\biggl y_i - y_j \biggr} < \tau\\
        1  & \text{if } \langle i,j \rangle \in E \\
        0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Degree Matrix}

The degree Matrix of $G$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    D_{ij} =    
    \begin{cases}
        %1  & \text{if } \norm{\biggl y_i - y_j \biggr} < \tau\\
        deg(v_i)  & \text{if } i = j \\
        0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where $deg(v_i)$ is the degree of the node, formally the number of incoming edges of node $v_i$.

\subsection{Graph Laplacian}
The graph Laplacian is defined as follows:
$L = D - A$

\subsubsection{Normalized Graph Laplacian}

Symmetric normalized: $L_{sym} = I - D^{-\frac{1}{2}} A D^{-\frac{1}{2}}$
Random walk normalized: $L_{rw} = I - D^{-1} A$


\subsection{Graph Properties}

\subsubsection{Directed vs. undirected vs. weighted}

\subsubsection{Dense and sparse Graph}
A dense graph is a graph, where the number of edges in close to the maximal number of edges.
Contrarily, a sparse graph only consists of a few edges.

\section{Graph Denoising}
Data acquired by Real-world observations are often noisy, which can lead to poor 
performance on data analysis tasks. This observed data can already be in the form of a graph,
or a graph can be easily constructed. This resulting graph is what we call
a noisy graph, as it includes the noise from the observation.

Graph denoising is the task to reconstruct the original graph from a noisy one.
Therefore, graph denoising can be seen as a pre-processing step, where noisy data is filtered.

Denoising in general has often to do with averaging \cite{noneLocalMean}
 and graphs are  a well suited data structure for this task.

\subsection{Noisy Graph}
For every noisy graph, there exists an original graph $G = \langle V,E \rangle$.

The noisy graph can be defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        G_{noisy} = \langle V,E_{noisy} \rangle \\ 
        \text{ where }  E_{noisy} = E \setminus  E^{-} \cup  E^{+} \\ 
        \text{ and } E^{-} \subseteq E  ,  E^{+} \cap E = \emptyset
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Basically, the noisy graph consists of the same vertices as the original graph. From
the original graphs edges, some are removed (denoted by $E^{-}$) and some new edges are added
(denoted by $E^{+}$).

The adjacency Matrix of $G_{noisy}$ is then defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{A}_{ij} =    
    \begin{cases}
        %1  & \text{if } \norm{\biggl y_i - y_j \biggr} < \tau\\
        1  & \text{if } \langle i,j \rangle \in E_{noisy} \\
        0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The task of graph denoising, can therefore be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{A} \xrightarrow[method]{Graph denoising} \tilde{A} \approx A
\end{equation}

Where $\bar{A}$ denotes the noisy input graph, $\tilde{A}$ the denoised
 graph and $A$ the original graph.


\subsection{Graph link prediction}
Link prediction is a task in Graph learning. 
The idea is to predict the existence of a link (edge) between two nodes.
The task can be formulated as a missing value estimation task. A model $M_p$ is learned
from a given set of observed edges. The model finally maps links to probabilities:


\begin{equation}
    M_p : E^{\prime} \rightarrow [0,1]
\end{equation}

Where $E^{\prime}$ is the set of potential links.


We define $U$ as the set of all possible vertices of $G$, therefore $E \subseteq U$.
Obviously, one could see Graph denoising as a link prediction problem.

The difference is, that in link prediction, we learn a model from a set of observed links 
$E_{observed} \subseteq E$ and in Graph denoising we learn the model from 
$E_{observed} \subseteq U$. 

On could also say that link prediction problems are a subset of graph denoising problems.


\textbf{Questions:}

Link prediction: learning model M from subset of E.
Graph denoising: learning model M from subset of U.

\section{Diffusion Maps:}
\citet{diffusionMaps}
\cite{diffusionMaps}

Dimensionality reduction:
In essence, the goal is to change the representation of data sets, originally in a form involving a large number of variables, into a
low-dimensional description using only a small number of free parameters.

meaningful structures in data sets:
Analogous to the problem of dimensionality reduction is that of finding meaningful structures in data sets. The idea here is slightly
different and the goal is to extract relevant features out of the data in order to gain insight and understanding of the
phenomenon that generated the data.

Markov Chain:

Random walk:

PageRank:
Stationary distribution of random walk

Kernel eigenmap methods:
- local linear embedding
- Laplacian eigenmaps,
- hessian eigenmaps
- local tangent space alignement

The remarkable idea emerging from these papers is that eigenvectors of Markov matrices can be thought of as coordinates
on the data set. Therefore, the data, originally modeled as a graph, can be represented (embedded) as a cloud of points
in a Euclidean space.
two major advantages over classical dimensionality redution (PCA, MDS):
The first aspect is essential as most of the time, in their original form, the data points do not lie on
 linear manifolds.
 The second point is the expression of the fact that in many
applications, distances of points that are far apart are meaningless, and therefore need not be preserved.

Unnormalized Graph Laplacian:
$L = D - W$

Normalized Graph Laplacian construction:
$L_{sym} = D^{-1/2}LD^{-1/2} = I - D^{-1/2}WD^{-1/2} $
$L_{rw} = D^{-1}L = I - D^{-1}W $

Markov chain has a stationary distribution.
If graph is connected, stationary is unique.
If X is finite, chian is ergodic.

Diffusion distance:
Diffusion map $\psi$ embeds the data into the Euclidean space so that in this space, the Euclidean
distance is equal to the diffusion distance.

What are diffusion maps

\subsection{Vector Diffusion Maps (VDM)}

\cite{vectorDiffusionMaps}
VDMis a mathematical and algorithmic generalization of diffusion maps
and other nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, such as LLE, ISOMAP,
and Laplacian eigenmaps. While existing methods are either directly or indirectly
related to the heat kernel for functions over the data, VDM is based on
the heat kernel for vector fields.

Main concept:
Edge consists of weight and linear orthogonal transformation.
If linear orthogonal transformation is big, nodes are more like to be equal.
If small, there are different

\subsection{Riemannian Manifold Assumption:}
One of the main objectives in the analysis of a high-dimensional large data set
is to learn its geometric and topological structure. Even though the data itself is
parametrized as a point cloud in a high-dimensional ambient space $R^p$, the correlation
between parameters often suggests the popular ‚Äúmanifold assumption‚Äù that
the data points are distributed on (or near) a single low-dimensional Riemannian
manifold Md embedded in Rp, where d is the dimension of the manifold and
$d << p$.


\subsection{Multi-Frequency Vector Diffusion Maps (MFVDM)}
\cite{multiDiffusionMaps}
\textbf{For a direct link between manifold embedding and tomography, very close to what Ivan explained this morning.
If we have a graph denoising method, we will need to compare with this approach 
(or the original vector diffusion maps).}

Basically same as VDM, but with multiple frequencies per edge.

Diffusion maps (DM) only consider scalar weights over the edges and the vector
diffusion maps (VDM) only take into account consistencies
of the transformations along connected edges using only one
representation of $SO(2)$, i.e. $e^{ia_{i,j}}$ . In this paper, we generalize
VDM and use not only one irreducible representation,
i.e. $k = 1$, but also higher order $k$ up to $k_{max}$.


\section{Graph Laplacian Tomography From Unknown Random Projections}
\textbf{A reference that I already mentioned in the first mail:
standard approach that we need to compare with. 
Maybe their setting (2D tomography with unknown angle) is a good setting to start with.

\section{denoising}
Recover original image from noisy observation.
Is Achieved by averaging.

- classical local smoothing filters:
    - gaussian filters
    - anisotropic filters
    - Total Variation minimization
    - neighborhood filters

- neighborhood filters (review of image denoising)
- non local means
- functions adapted kernels (nonlinear independent component analysis)


\section{Non-local means}
Image denoising accuratly done.

Better performance, when algorithms tries to correct noise rather than seperate noise
from original image.

Compares similar pixel neighborhoods and assign large weighted for similar pixels.
