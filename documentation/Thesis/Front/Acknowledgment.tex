\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Prof. Dr. Ivan Dokmanić
for giving me the opportunity to conduct my Master's Thesis in the 
Data-Analytics group.

\bigskip

Further, I am extremely grateful for the support by my supervisors
Dr. Valentin Debarnot and Cheng Shi. We had helpful discussions
throughout the project and their valuable feedback was more than welcome,
helping me to finish my Master Thesis in quality it has reached.

\bigskip
Additionally, many thanks Patrick Arnold and Marc Hennemann and for 
proofreading the Thesis, their feedback was greatly appreciated.

\bigskip
Words cannot express my gratitude for my wife Luana, my family and friends,
for the support during the last years.
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
