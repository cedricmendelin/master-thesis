\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Prof. Dr. Ivan DokmaniÄ‡
for giving me the opportunity to conduct my Master's Thesis in the 
Signals and Data Group.

\bigskip

Further, I am extremely grateful for the support by my supervisors
Dr. Valentin Debarnot and Cheng Shi. We had inspiring discussions
throughout the project and their valuable feedback was more than welcome,
helping me to finish my Thesis in an adequate quality.

\bigskip
Many thanks to Patrick Arnold and Marc Hennemann for 
proofreading this report, their feedback was greatly appreciated.

\bigskip
Words cannot express my gratitude to my wife Luana, my family and friends,
for the support during the last years.
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
