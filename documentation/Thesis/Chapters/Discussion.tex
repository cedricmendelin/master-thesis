\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item GAT for denoising works with Manifold Assumption
  \item U-Net boosts performance
  \item U-Net could even be trained better (not SNR interval, longer)
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add Convolution in other way (in GAT directly? multiple Convolution layers before GAT?)
  \item Drop assumption about known angles.
  \item Move problem to 3D (first 3D CT, then cryo-EM)
\end{itemize}
