\chapter{Questions}


\textbf{Organization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Presentation, date and content?
    \item Contract of Thesis
    \item Project plan
    \item How detailed Related work?
    \item Send Reminder to Ivan (end of the week)?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Feedback questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ML power method to Graph Laplacian
        Compute Evec of Laplacian which works for ML?
    \item Aim expolit Connection between the GNN and Graph Laplacian.
    \item Mathematical analysis of the link between Graph neural network and Graph Laplacian, as in the paper "Simplifying graph convolutional networks". Another strong idea to explore.
    \item FSM may be used at some point, but maybe not.
    \item link with signal processing (paragraph currently called "Manifold assumption") -> common in signal processing.
    \item 3.3: discretization of problem
    \item Define SNR Ratio we want to work with. (V Shape should be solveable)

\end{itemize}
