\chapter{Master Thesis project}
\label{sec:projectOverview}
In the last chapter of the report, a short conclusion of the Thesis problem is given.
Further, the project plan will be introduced as well as a broad overview of different 
work packages. Finally, the project schedule can be seen as a Gantt chart.

\section{Problem conclusion}

Cryo-Em and computed tomography within high noise regime is the field of interest.
In both imaging methods, the final goal is to reconstruct an original object from observed noisy data. 
Better denoising will boost the overall quality of reconstruction. 

The Master Thesis will therefore introduce a new method for denoising. 
We believe, that graphs are a well suited data structure for denoising.
Additionally, we hope to explore further connection of the powerful Graph Laplacian
and Machine Learning and use it to estimate a denoised graph from a noisy one.
Further, the idea is to exploit the fact, that the manifold of the 
noise-less input data is known.

\section{Evaluation:}
The introduced denoising method will be evaluated during Master Thesis, where 2D and 3D scenario will be considered.
A first evaluation will be done on artificial constructed toy-dataset.
As the goal is to work with highly noisy data,
the noise level can be selected and increased when working with toy datasets. 
The evaluation in 2D is crucial and needs to in a satisfying matter. 
It does not make sense to continue with 3D implementation, when the simple 2D case is not handled well enough.
If time allows, real dataset from classical tomography and/or cryo-EM\footnote{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/} can be evaluated as well.

During evaluation, two baselines are considered, which already solved part of the problem. 
The first one is a multi-frequency diffusion map approach\cite{multiDiffusionMaps, cryoEmMutliDM}, which aims to denoise cryo-EM images. 
Secondly, \cite{LaplaceRandomProjections} a Graph Laplacian approach solving classical tomography with random projection angles will be compared against
(only possible in 2D case).

The evaluation process is a first broad idea. Any adjustments in baseline papers or dataset are possible during 
Master Thesis.

\section{Work packages}
In the upcoming section, some work packages are defined.
Probably, there are some parts of the project which will not work out as expected and 
adjustments are needed throughout the Thesis.
The project plan can be seen as a rough guideline.

\paragraph{Implement algorithm for 2D case:}
The first step will be to familiarize with the problem and implement
the algorithm for 2D. 

\paragraph{Evaluate 2D case on toy dataset and implement baselines:}
As a second step, the implemented 2D algorithm will be tested on a toy dataset,
where noise is added to images by hand. 

\paragraph{Implement algorithm for 3D case:}
After successfully evaluating the algorithm in 2D, the goal is to extend the algorithm to work in 3D as well.

\paragraph{Evaluate 3D case on toy dataset and adjust baselines:}
Again, implementation will be evaluated on a toy dataset, where noise can be adjusted by hand.


\paragraph{Nice to have: Evaluate of real dataset}
If time allows and 2D and 3D implementation are evaluated successfully on toy datasets, 
real data can be used for further evaluation.


\paragraph{Writing Thesis:}
Document implementation and evaluation result and write final Master Thesis report.
