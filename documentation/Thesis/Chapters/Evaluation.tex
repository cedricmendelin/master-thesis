\label{sec:results}

In this chapter, the results of GAT-Denoiser evaluation are presented.
First, the LoDoPaB-CT dataset is introduced.
Second, the project setup and shared settings during evaluation are defined.
Third, small scale GAT-Denoiser experiments are presented, where the goal is to find
good parameters for training the GAT-Denoiser model. 
Last, the large scale GAT-Denoiser experiments are presented, where the goal is 
to find the best model.



\section{Dataset}
GAT-Denoiser is tested on the LoDoPaB-CT~\cite{lodopab-dataset} dataset, which is a 
benchmark dataset for low-dose CT reconstruction methods and, therefore, well suited for our domain.

The dataset consists of 35'820 train samples and 3'553 test samples.
All of them are having resolution 64x64.

\section{Project Setup}
The python source code of the project is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/cedricmendelin/master-thesis}.
Several python packages are used and the most important one are: Pytorch geometric\footnote{https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/} 
for neural network configuration, Operator Discretization Library\footnote{https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/} for Radon Transform and FBP, 
and last, Weight \& Bias\footnote{https://wandb.ai/site} (wandb) to gather results in a convenient way.

Training of GAT-Denoiser has been performed on the HPC-cluster scicore of the University of Basel.
During training, up to 4 titanx GPUs with each 12 GB RAM have been used.


\paragraph{Radon Transform:}
For Radon Transform, sampling points have been fixed to 64, thus $s \in \mathbb{R}^{64}$.
Further, projection angles $\theta$ are sampled within interval $[0, \pi]$.
The number of observations is the size of our input graph nodes, where typically 1024 are used.

\paragraph{GAT Settings:}
In the GAT layers exponential linear unit (ELU) was applied as an activation function.
Further, dropout is used as a regularization term.
During training, Adam~\cite{adam} optimizer was applied with learning rate $0.01$ and weight decay $0.0005$.
Moreover, mini batch gradient descent with a batch size of 64 was applied during training.

\paragraph{Performance Metrics:}
During evaluation, two main metrics are considered.
First, \textit{Loss} is taken into account, which refers to the average $\ell$-2 distance between the biological sample and reconstruction.
Second, \textit{SNR} is used, which refers to SNR in dB of reconstruction, compared to the biological sample.
Further, visual results are presented and can be seen as a third metric.


\paragraph{U-Net Training:}
U-Net was pre-trained on the LoDoPaB-CT training dataset, with 128 channels in the first contracting step. 
In total, 4 steps have been computed, which results in 1024 channels as output of last contracting step.
During training, noise was sampled from normal distribution to reach SNR in the interval $[-10, 0]$ dB 
and was added to the observation. In total, the model was trained for 200 epochs on the complete LoDoPaB-CT dataset.

\paragraph{BM3D:}
In the GAT-Denoiser pipeline, first, observations will be denoised, and second, reconstruction is computed.
Therefore, BM3D can be applied at two different steps. First, it can be used to denoise sinogram
and forward denoised sinogram to FBP, which is how GAT-Denoiser works. Secondly, FBP can be
computed with noisy sinogram and output can be forwarded to BM3D, which will denoise reconstruction.
In the following term \textit{BM3D-sino} and \textit{BM3D-reco} are used to distinguish between the two approaches.

\section{Small Scale Experiments}
For small scale experiments, not the complete LoDoPaB-CT dataset was considered, but only 1024 train images
and 100 validation images. 
The default settings for GAT-Denoiser have been: \snry -5 dB, U-Net omitted during reconstruction, 
convolution with one channel, kernel size 3 and padding 1. 
If nothing else mentioned, these settings are applied.
Models have been trained for 200 epochs. Based on 100 test samples,
SNR and Loss metrics have been computed as well as visual results. 
Wandb experiment results can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:wandb}.

In the following sections, the results of the baseline algorithms will be presented.
Further, experiments with different input graphs and $k$ are shown. 
Moreover, the individual GAT-Denoiser pipeline components are tested in isolation.
Experiments with different GAT parameters, convolution settings and Loss are presented step-by-step.
Finally, different promising architectures have been evaluated to finalize the small scale experiment.


\subsection{Baseline}

Table~\ref{tab:baseline-small} shows baseline results for FBP, BM3D-sino, BM3D-reco and U-Net.
Noise was added to reach \snry of 0, -5, -10 and -15 dB.

As expected, reconstruction with FBP performs the worst, as it only reconstructs from noisy observation.
BM3D-sino and BM3D-reco perform surprisingly well for higher $\textit{SNR}_y$.
However, for lower \snry the algorithm performs poorly.
Figure~\ref{fig:baseline_small} illustrates the reconstruction of a single
observation for all baseline algorithms. \snry is set to 0 dB.

U-Net reconstruction looks visually best, even tough the SNR was lower compared to the BM3D approaches.
After some investigation, a small bug in the pre-trained U-Net model was found.
There was an issue with the amplitude of U-Net reconstruction,
therefore the SNR values of U-Net are expected to be slightly better.
But also the pre-trained U-Net model starts to fail reconstruction with lower $\textit{SNR}_y$.

 \subsection{K-NN Experiments}
  In the following section, experiments with different input graphs are presented.
  Therefore, some other parameters are fixed for all experiments.
  GAT-Denoiser has been set to 3 layers with GAT single head and convolution. 
  Noise was added to reach \snry 0 dB.
  The input graph structure is important for GAT learning.
  In our case, the input graph was fixed after examination of GL embedding.
  Moreover, learning is expected to fail on a random graph.

  \clearpage

  \paragraph{Does learning fail with a random graph?}
  Yes it does.

  During this experiment, two models with different input graphs, but same number of nodes 1024 have been trained.
  First, a k-NN graph with $k=10$ was defined as input, therefore, around 1\% of all nodes are connected in the graph.
  Second, a random Erdős–Rényi graph with $p=0.01$ has been evaluated, where every node is 
  connected to every other node with probability $p$. 
  As a consequence, nodes are approximately connected to 1\% of all available nodes as well and 
  evaluation should allow a fair comparison.
  
  Table~\ref{tab:input_graph} shows Loss and SNR and in Figure~\ref{fig:input_graph_small} example reconstruction is illustrated.
  In the reconstruction from Erdős–Rényi graph, no details are captured (\ref{fig:small_experiment_random_graph}) and it clearly failed. 
  The reconstruction quality of GAT-Denoiser in Figure~\ref{fig:small_experiment_knn_graph} is rather low. 
  However, it starts learning a few coarse details and with the upcoming experiments, the reconstruction can hopefully be 
  increased in quality. But, our approach to define the input graph, based on the assumption of 
  the underlying low-dimensional manifold to be on a circle, is reasonable.

  \paragraph{Does result improve with more observations?}
  Yes.
  For this question to answer, multiple models have been trained for graphs with 512, 1024 and 2048 observations
  as well as different $k = (2,6,8,10,20)$.
  In Table~\ref{tab:graph_knn} results are presented, where results are averaged by the number of observations 
  for different $k$.
  A larger number of nodes can improve the models. 
  But, training is also more expensive regarding execution time. 
  Therefore, for all upcoming experiments number of observations is fixed to 1024, as it looks like a good
  value in between, with good reconstruction results but also not too much training time.

    \caption{Small Scale Experiment: Loss and SNR for different number of observations averaged by $k$.}
    \label{tab:graph_knn}
  \end{table}

  \paragraph{What is a good value for  $k$?}

  To find suitable $k$, multiple models have been trained with different $k=(1,2,3,4,6,8,10,20)$
  as well as different \snry (0 dB and -10 dB).
  In Table~\ref{tab:small_knn_snr} the results of the evaluated models are presented.
  For \snry 0 dB the best result can be achieved with $k=2$ and for \snry -10 dB $k=1$.
  With our assumption of fixed angles, and 1024 observations, it looks like only a few neighbors are enough to capture 
  important information in the neighborhood.

\subsection{GAT Experiments}
In this section, experiments are presented with a focus on the GAT and its parameters.
Mainly, two parameters are of interest: number of heads and number of layers.
Number of layers is expected to keep rather low, as it defines the exposure of the k-hop neighborhood.
The observations have only resolution 64x64 and consequently, it is expected that too many layers will 
average a too large neighborhood.
Further, the number of heads determines if the learned weight matrix is divided into several parts.
The larger the number of heads, the smaller are the parts of the weight matrix.
Overall, a larger number of heads is expected to smoothen denoising, but too large values
will divide weight matrix in too many parts, leading to bad results.

Experiments have been computed in parallel and the results for the k-NN experiments have not been available. 
Therefore, graphs were constructed with $k=8$, even tough it is not the best value for $k$.
Further, multiple experiments with layers = $(2,3,4,6)$ and heads = $(1,2,4,8,16)$ have been evaluated.
Results are illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:small_gat_results}.

    \midrule
  \end{tabular}}
  \caption{Small Scale Experiment: Different GAT parameters.}
  \label{tab:small_gat_results}
\end{table}


\paragraph{The more layers the better result?}
No. As expected, when working with too many layers, denoising starts failing as it averages over a
neighborhood, which is too large. In Table~\ref{tab:small_gat_results}, 6 layers clearly get the worst result,
followed by 4, 3 and 2 layers.

\paragraph{How do multiple heads affect the result?}
It has an overall positive impact. 
During experiments, for every layer $l$ with single-head, there is a better result for $l$, where multiple-heads are applied. 
For $l=2$, single-head model performs with an average SNR of 7.55 dB where with 16 heads average SNR is 8.27.

2 layers seems to be most promising and number of heads 4 seems to be a reasonable choice for heads.
With 16 heads, the result was even a bit better. As 16 heads performed rather low for other number of layers, 
the best GAT parameters for the LoDoPaB-CT dataset are considered to be 2 layers and 4 heads.
To make sure that $k=2$ is a good setting for these GAT parameters, the k-NN experiment
has been recomputed for 2 layers and 4 heads. Table~\ref{tab:small_knn_2} presents results, which 
give the same insight as the previous k-NN experiments.

\paragraph{How about some dropout?}
An experiment with fixed network parameters
and different dropout values $(0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1)$ has been computed. 
Results are presented in Figure~\ref{tab:small_dropout}.
There is not too much of a difference. Without dropout, model got the best value, followed by 
0.05 and 0.03 with almost the same result. 

Therefore, in future trainings, dropout of 0.05 was used.

\subsection{Convolution Experiments}

For convolution, kernel size and padding can be defined.
Moreover, it is possible to increase number of channels during convolution. 
For GAT, the number of layers determines the averaging neighborhood.
As multiple channels are expected to perform better with multiple layers,
there could be a trade-off between GAT quality (size of averaging neighborhood) and convolution quality (increasing number of channels). 

First, some experiments with 4 layers and 2 heads have been executed with different number of kernel, padding and number of channels.
The aim is to find good convolution kernel and padding parameter values.

\paragraph{What is a good kernel size?}

In Table~\ref{tab:small_convolution} results are illustrated. 
Best results are achieved with only 1 channel and smallest kernel size of 3 with padding 1.
This is not too big of a surprise, observation dimension is only 64 and, therefore, a smaller kernel size make sense.

  \caption{Small Scale Experiment: Convolution for GAT-Denoiser with 4 layers and 2 heads.}
  \label{tab:small_convolution}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Is there a trade-off between GAT and Convolution?}

As kernel size 3 with padding 1 seems to be a good value for the LoDoPaB-CT dataset, 
in the second convolution experiment different GAT architectures are compared with kernel size 3.
Good performing GAT architectures for layers 2 to 4 have been chosen: 2 layers with 4 heads, 3 layers with 8 heads
and 4 layers with 2 heads.

The resulting evaluation is illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:small_convolution_2}.
Additionally, for every GAT architecture model without convolution has been computed.
For every architecture, there was a model with convolution which performed better than the one without convolution.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
  Convolution can be considered to contribute to the success of GAT-Denoiser.

\subsection{Loss Experiments}
An experiment was set up to compare $\mathcal{L}$ from Equation~\ref{eq:loss_reco} 
with $\mathcal{L}_{sino}$ from Equation~\ref{eq:loss_sino}.
The same network parameters have been used, but once loss during training was defined 
with $\mathcal{L}$ and once $\mathcal{L}_{sino}$. The experiments
have been computed for \snry 0, -5, -10 and -15 dB.

\paragraph{Is end-to-end learning a good idea?}
Yes, but it comes with a price. 
Averaged results over training loss can be found in Table~\ref{tab:loss_sino_reco}. 
Overall, the models trained with loss $\mathcal{L} $ performed around 0.8 dB in SNR better.
But, training of the network took much longer, more than factor 3. 
This is not a big surprise. For learning with $\mathcal{L} $, reconstruction of every sample
needs to be done in every epoch, where for $\mathcal{L}_{sino}$ reconstruction can be omitted.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
  End-to-end learning with loss $\mathcal{L} $ contributes to the success of GAT-Denoiser and 
   is used in further experiments.

\subsection{GAT-Denoiser Component Experiments}

The final small scale experiments aim to see contribution of the single components in action.
Therefore, a fixed overall architecture is defined and experiments
with different combination of components (Convolution, GAT and U-Net) will be calculated.
Further, models with joint U-Net training have been evaluated.
The fixed settings for GAT-Denoiser have been defined with 2 layers, 4 heads, convolution with 
kernel size 3 and padding 1. $k$ was set to 2.
Overall, 8 models have been evaluated and compared against the baseline algorithms for  \snry $ = (-15,-10,-5,0) $ dB.

Results are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:small_components} and numeric values can be found in Table~\ref{tab:small_gat_components}.
First, \textit{GAT} is the model, where no convolution and no U-Net is active. 
Second, \textit{GAT+Conv} refers to the model with GAT and convolution but no U-Net.
Additionally, the two models have been combined with U-Net, which are referred to as 
\textit{GAT+U-Net} and \textit{Conv+GAT+U-Net}.
Last, models with joint U-Net training are presented.
\textit{U-Net*} denotes that during all 200 epochs U-Net is jointly trained.
\textit{U-Net**} denotes that during the first 100 epochs U-Net is kept static 
and in the second 100 epochs  joint training is applied.

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{small_components_result.png}
  \caption{Small Scale Experiments: Reconstruction SNR of different GAT-Denoiser models and baseline algorithms.}
  \label{fig:small_components}
\end{figure}

Model \textit{GAT} is not able to beat baseline algorithms, and it seems that only applying GAT is not enough.
\textit{GAT+Conv} performs slightly better. When adding U-Net in the models \textit{GAT+U-Net}  and \textit{Conv+GAT+U-Net},
the visual results improve slightly, but reconstruction SNR is still not able to beat baseline algorithms.
Finally, with joint training of GAT-Denoiser and U-Net, 
results can beat baseline algorithms for the small scale experiment. It was helpful, to first train only GAT-Denoiser for 100 epochs 
and start joint training for the second 100 epochs.

Figure~\ref{fig:small_components_overview} illustrates visual results for all baseline algorithms and some GAT-Denoiser models.
Further, clean sample is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:small_clean_sample_overview}.

\section{Large Scale Experiments}

In this section, large scale experiments are presented, which have been trained on the complete LoDoPaB-CT dataset
as well as evaluated on the complete LoDoPaB-CT test dataset.
From last section, the most promising parameters for the GAT-Denoiser architecture have been chosen
to find the best model. The following parameters have been fixed during the large scale experiments:
$k=2$, number of layers = 2, number of heads = 4, convolution with kernel size 3 and padding 1.
The GAT-Denoiser models have been trained for 20 epochs, if not mentioned differently.
Wandb experiment results can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:wandb}.


\subsection{Baseline}
In Table~\ref{tab:baseline-large}, baseline results for the large scale experiment can be found.
As only the number of samples changed, but algorithms are fixed, the result is roughly 
the same as for the small scale experiments.

\subsection{GAT-Denoiser Components Experiments}
The main components of the GAT-Denoiser pipeline have been tested with different models.
As a result of the small scale experiments, joint U-Net training was most promising, 
when there was first training on GAT-Denoiser solely and in a second step joint training.
Therefore, model {Conv + GAT + U-Net*} and {GAT+U-Net*} is omitted for the large scale experiments.
Moreover, {... U-Net**} denotes that models have been first trained 10 epochs with
static U-Net and after with joint U-Net training.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{large_components_result.png}
  \caption{Large Scale Experiments: Reconstruction SNR of different GAT-Denoiser models and baseline algorithms.}
  \label{fig:large_components}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:large_components} presents resulting SNR for baseline algorithms and 
different GAT-Denoiser models. Further, numerical results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:large_gat_components_knn2}.
The results are rather similar compared to the small scale experiments.
Overall reconstruction is slightly better, as during training more samples have been seen.
Again, approaches with joint U-Net and GAT-Denoiser training performed best.

\subsection{Best Models Experiments}
For the most promising architectures, the models have been further trained for 20 epochs. 
In Table~\ref{tab:large_best_models} final results are illustrated. 
The number in brackets denotes the number of training epochs with static U-Net followed by
the number of epochs with joint training.

All in all, a few more epochs could sometimes improve the result, as for \textit{Conv+GAT+U-Net} and \snry 0 dB.
Although, this is not always the case, and in some scenarios the model even performed worse, as for 
\textit{GAT+U-Net} and \snry -10 dB.
