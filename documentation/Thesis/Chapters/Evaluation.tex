\chapter{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In the current chapter, results of GAT-Denoiser are presented.
First, some small experiments are presented, which do not work on full dataset.
These experiments have been done to find the best suitable architecture and to 
familiarize with the problem and its structure.
Second, a few large experiments are presented, which work on full dataset.
During small and large experiments, some interesting findings are illustrated and GAT-Denoiser
is compared to U-Net and block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) \cite{bm3d}.


\section{Dataset}
GAT-Denoiser is tested on lodopab-ct dataset \cite{lodopab-dataset}, which is a 
benchmark dataset for low-dose ct reconstruction methods and therefore well suited for our domain.

The dataset consists of 35820 train images and 3553 test images.
All these images are having resolution 64.

\section{Training setup}
Training of GAT-Denoiser has been done on the HPC-cluster scicore of the University of Basel.
During training, up to 4 titanx GPUs with 12 GB RAM have been used.


\section{Source code}
Source code of the project is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/cedricmendelin/master-thesis}.

\subsection{Python packages}
The following important python packages have been:


\section{Small Experiments}
Some small experiments to find best suited architecture for GAT-Denoiser.
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1024 train images
  \item 100 validation images
\end{itemize}

Test many different settings:
\begin{itemize}
  \item K-nn size ([2,4,6,8,10,12]) and sampling points / Graph feature dimension (512, 1024, 1536, 2048)
 
  \item GAT architecute (Layers, Heads, Loss FBP, Fixed conv)
  \item Convolution (with, without, multiple channels)
  \item Loss Sino and FBP
  \item U-Net with and without
  \item Different SNR levels
  \item Learning over SNR range? (slighly not)
  
  
\end{itemize}


\section{Complete Experiments}
Use complete set of experiment dataset.

Compare with :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only FBP
  \item FBP  + U-Net
  \item FBP  + Bm3d
  \item bm3d on sino + FBP
  \item Evantually same with non-local means
\end{itemize}
Compare with Bm3d (applied to noisy sinogram, after FBP and after FBP + Unet)
