\section{GAT-Denoiser}


Motivation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sinogram can be reconstructed nicely with known angles.
  \item If angles are unknown, angles can be estimated by 1D manifold.
  \item K-nn parameter is crucial (add simpel example)
  \item If sinogram is noisy, k-nn is even harder
  \item What to do in high-noisy regime?
\end{itemize}

Assumption:
Circle Graph good approximation of "true" observation angles:

To check:
Train GAT-Denoiser with equally sampled points but denoise with
normal distributed points.
(No code change needed).

To check:
Traing GAT-Denoiser with normal distributed sampled points.
(Initialize different odl operators)



\begin{itemize}
  \item Angles 
  \item Importance of K-nn 
  \item Introduce GAT-Denoiser
  \item Show/illustrate - GAT Architecture
  \item Potential of Forward / Backward domain
  \item Loss L1 and L2
  \item Works with circle-graph, not with random-graph
\end{itemize}
