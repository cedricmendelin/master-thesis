Inverse problems aim to estimate an original signal that went through a system, based on the output signal observation.
Machine learning (ML) is a tool to model and solve such inverse problems.
They are widely used throughout different science directions, such as ML,
signal processing, computer vision, natural language processing and many more.

In recent years, graphs got a lot of attention in ML and are one of the most promising research areas.
Graphs are a well suited data structure, simple but with high expressiveness. 
For some specific scenarios ordinary ML algorithm fail but Graph ML approaches have great success, e.g dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data.
Data can be in a graph structure already, like social networks, or they can be constructed for arbitrary datasets.


Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), where molecules are imaged in an electron microscope,
gained a lot of attention in recent years. 
Due to ground-breaking improvements regarding hardware and data processing, the field of research
has highly improved. In 2017, the pioneers in the field of cryo-EM got the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry\footnote{https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2017/press-release/}.
Today, using cryo-EM many molecular structures can be displayed with near-atomic resolution.
The big challenge with cryo-EM is enormous noise, which makes calculation challenging.

The following report resulted as the Master Thesis Preparation report. During the six week project, 
the aim was to familiarize with the research area, build up some mathematical foundation 
and define the project content as well as a project plan.
The report is structured the following:

In chapter~\ref{sec:imaging}, the main motivation of the Master Thesis is given. The two imaging methods
computed tomography and cryo-EM are introduced and an abstract model for dealing with both methods is defined.
Chapter~\ref{sec:graphDenoising} is dedicated to graphs, were the connection of graphs to computed tomography and 
cryo-EM is established. Further, the problem of "Graph Denoising" is defined and methods like graph construction and Graph Laplacian
is introduced.
Finally, in chapter~\ref{sec:projectOverview} the project content in shortly concluded, work packages are defined and the project schedule is given.
Throughout the report, red boxes are used to denote important statements and connections regarding the Master Thesis.
